# BME-280 sensor device driver with Micropython and Linux support (I2C + SPI)

[Project website](https://bues.ch/)

[Git repository](https://bues.ch/cgit/bme280-upy.git)

This driver runs on Micropython and on regular Python (e.g. Raspberry Pi or other Linux devices).

It has support for both I2C and SPI bus.

# Example: I2C

    import bme280

    try:
        # Connect to BME-280 via I2C-0 hardware with default pinning:
        bme = bme280.BME280(i2cBus=0)

        # Alternatively:
        # Connect to BME-280 via I2C-0 hardware with custom pinning (not supported by all microcontrollers):
        #bme = bme280.BME280(i2cBus={ "index": 0, "scl": 1, "sda": 0 })

        # Alternatively:
        # Connect to BME-280 via software I2C with custom pinning (not supported by all microcontrollers):
        #bme = bme280.BME280(i2cBus={ "scl": 1, "sda": 0 })

        # Alternatively:
        # Connect to BME-280 via pre-initialized Micropython bus object:
        #bme = bme280.BME280(i2cBus=machine.I2C(0, ...))

        # Synchronously trigger a MODE_FORCED conversion and return the result.

# Example: SPI

        #bme = bme280.BME280(spiBus={ "index": 0, "sck": 1, "mosi": 2, "miso": 3 }, spiCS=5)

        # Alternatively:
        # Connect to BME-280 via software SPI with custom pinning (not supported by all microcontrollers):
        #bme = bme280.BME280(spiBus={ "sck": 1, "mosi": 2, "miso": 3 }, spiCS=5)

        # Alternatively:

# Example: Context Manager

The BME280 instance can also be used as Context Manager (Python `with` statement).

    import bme280

    try:

            # ...
    except bme280.BME280Error as e:
        print(f"BME280 error: {e}")

# Example: Normal mode

The driver also supports normal mode, where the bme280 does all measurements on its own in the background.
See the datasheet for more information about normal mode.

    import bme280

    try:
        with bme280.BME280(i2cBus=0) as bme:
            # Start in normal mode with specified measurement interval (standby time).
            bme.start(mode=bme280.MODE_NORMAL,
                      standbyTime=bme280.T_SB_10ms,
                      filter=bme280.FILTER_2,
                      tempOversampling=bme280.OVSMPL_4,
                      humidityOversampling=bme280.OVSMPL_4,
                      pressureOversampling=bme280.OVSMPL_4)

            while True:
                # Read the most recent values from the device.
                temperature, humidity, pressure = bme.read()

                # ... do something else here and let the bme280 run measurements in the mean time.

    except bme280.BME280Error as e:
        print(f"BME280 error: {e}")
